# Google \#Hash Code 2017

Solutions and code for the [Google \#Hash Code 2017 Challenge](https://hashcode.withgoogle.com) of our Team _Gyrating Flibbittygibbitts_.

Here are the full [\#Hash Code 2017 results](https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/hashcode_2017.html) of both rounds.

## Final Round

The problem statement can be found [here](Final%20Round/hashcode2017_router_placement.pdf).
Our solution is in the [Final Round folder](Final%20Round).

> Who doesn't love wireless Internet?
> Millions of people rely on it for productivity and fun in countless cafes, railway stations and public areas of all sorts.
> For many institutions, ensuring wireless Internet access is now almost as important a feature of building facilities as the access to water and electricity.
> Typically, buildings are connected to the Internet using a fiber backbone.
> In order to provide wireless Internet access, wireless routers are placed around the building and connected using fiber cables to the backbone.
> The larger and more complex the building, the harder it is to pick router locations and decide how to lay down the connecting cables.

## Online Qualification Round

The problem statement can be found [here](Online%20Qualification%20Round/hashcode2017_streaming_videos.pdf).
Our solution is in the [Online Qualification Round folder](Online%20Qualification%20Round).

> Have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when you watch a YouTube video? 
> As more and more people watch online videos (and as the size of these videos increases), it is critical that video-serving infrastructure is optimized to handle requests reliably and quickly.
> This typically involves putting in place cache servers, which store copies of popular videos.
> When a user request for a particular video arrives, it can be handled by a cache server close to the user, rather than by a remote data center thousands of kilometers away.
> Given a description of cache servers, network endpoints and videos, along with predicted requests for individual videos, decide which videos to put in which cache server in order to minimize the average waiting time for all requests.
