> Who doesn't love wireless Internet?
> Millions of people rely on it for productivity and fun in countless cafes, railway stations and public areas of all sorts.
> For many institutions, ensuring wireless Internet access is now almost as important a feature of building facilities as the access to water and electricity.
> Typically, buildings are connected to the Internet using a fiber backbone.
> In order to provide wireless Internet access, wireless routers are placed around the building and connected using fiber cables to the backbone.
> The larger and more complex the building, the harder it is to pick router locations and decide how to lay down the connecting cables.
